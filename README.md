# Midnight Science Plotter
Effectively visualizing data is as important as producing good data. 
This is why Midnight Science focused on developing thid plotting tools.
This is not the usual one-window app that allows you to skim thorugh your data, but it allows you to create and save a full project comparing data from multiple files, adjusting units, and modify line styles, colors, and markers.
While this plotter has been developed to interface with the format of the result files generated using Midnight Science software suit, it can be easily modified to work with any other file format.
